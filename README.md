# Repeat Front Instructions  
```md 
Given a string and an int n, create a new string
made of the first n characters of the original
string, followed by the first n-1 characters of
the original string, and so on. You may assume
that n is between 0 and the length of the string,
inclusive (i.e. n >= 0 and n <= str.length())

Output 
"Chocolate", 4 -> "ChocChoChC"
"Chocolate", 3 -> "ChoChC"
"Ice Cream", 2 -> "IcI"
